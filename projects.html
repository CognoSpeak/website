            <h3>COMPutational Assessment of Stroke Survivors (COMPASS)</h3>

            <em>Background & Significance</em> Stroke affects 152,000 UK citizens every year. Over 50% of stroke
            survivors have cognitive impairment. Currently 850,000 people live with dementia in the UK and stroke is one
            of the biggest risk factors. National guidelines promote early cognitive testing on all people who have had
            a stroke. However, current pen-and-paper based tests are not always appropriate for stroke survivors who
            often have motor, visual or language difficulties. In addition, longitudinal follow-up is required to detect
            emerging cognitive impairment. Finally, assessments typically take place in hospital settings, are costly
            and often inconvenient for patients.

            <em>Aim & Objectives</em> This project aims to create an easy-to-use cognitive assessment tool specifically
            designed for the needs of stroke survivors. It will be based on our stratification tool COCOA (COmputational
            COgnitive Assessment), developed for detecting early signs of dementia. The tool uses automatic analysis of
            conversations that patients have with an on-screen digital doctor. This includes verbal fluency and a
            picture description task. The conversation and responses to questions are analysed for signs of cognitive
            decline using speech recognition and machine learning classification. We have demonstrated high
            stratification accuracy in distinguishing between healthy controls, people with mild cognitive impairment
            (MCI) and people with Alzheimer’s disease. Feedback suggests that patients find the system straightforward
            and pleasant to use.

            <h3>HPC</h3>
            <p>The Department of Health has identified a need to utilise technology to help manage demand on memory
                clinic assessments, accurately detecting progression from MCI (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer’s
                Disease and improving efficiency of staff time. Occupational Therapists (OTs) play a key role in the
                management of people with MCI (PwMCI), running follow-up clinics at both Sheffield memory clinics.

                There is a national challenge with missed appointments costing the NHS £150 million per year. Digital
                remote appointments are a solution to address this challenge.

                CognoSpeak is an automated cognitive assessment tool that uses an on-screen Digital Doctor asking
                questions and analysing spoken responses. It can distinguish between AD, MCI and healthy controls and
                can be repeated over time.

                This project will investigate whether OTs can assess PwMCI in their own home using CognoSpeak in
                combination with the ViVA remote visit system. PwMCI would use their own smartphone or tablet
                (facilitated by support worker or family member) or have one provided.

                In a recent stakeholder, patient and public consultation the opportunity to utilise technology to
                minimise hospital attendance and bring care closer to home was viewed positively.

                We will run workshops involving all end-users on what is required to use technology to manage PwMCI
                remotely. We will recruit 10 PwMCI to use this system in a real clinical setting from the two hospital
                memory clinics in Sheffield.

                This is a new collaboration between STH, SHSCT, TUoS, SHU, Sheffield City Council and Age UK.</p>
