            <h3>COMPutational Assessment of Stroke Survivors (COMPASS)</h3>

            <em>Background & Significance</em> Stroke affects 152,000 UK citizens every year. Over 50% of stroke
            survivors have cognitive impairment. Currently 850,000 people live with dementia in the UK and stroke is one
            of the biggest risk factors. National guidelines promote early cognitive testing on all people who have had
            a stroke. However, current pen-and-paper based tests are not always appropriate for stroke survivors who
            often have motor, visual or language difficulties. In addition, longitudinal follow-up is required to detect
            emerging cognitive impairment. Finally, assessments typically take place in hospital settings, are costly
            and often inconvenient for patients.

            <em>Aim & Objectives</em> This project aims to create an easy-to-use cognitive assessment tool specifically
            designed for the needs of stroke survivors. It will be based on our stratification tool COCOA (COmputational
            COgnitive Assessment), developed for detecting early signs of dementia. The tool uses automatic analysis of
            conversations that patients have with an on-screen digital doctor. This includes verbal fluency and a
            picture description task. The conversation and responses to questions are analysed for signs of cognitive
            decline using speech recognition and machine learning classification. We have demonstrated high
            stratification accuracy in distinguishing between healthy controls, people with mild cognitive impairment
            (MCI) and people with Alzheimer’s disease. Feedback suggests that patients find the system straightforward
            and pleasant to use.

            <h3>Training Network on Processing of Pathological Speech (TAPAS)</h3>

            <p><em>Project Description</em>
                There are an increasing number of people across Europe with debilitating speech pathologies (e.g., due
                to stroke, Parkinson’s, etc). These groups face communication problems that can lead to social
                exclusion. They are now being further marginalised by a new wave of speech technology that is
                increasingly woven into everyday life but which is not robust to atypical speech. TAPAS is a Horizon
                2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Network European Training Network (MSCA-ITN-ETN)
                project that aims to transform the well being of these people.

                The <a href="tapas-etn-eu.org">TAPAS</a> work programme targets three key research problems:

                Detection: We will develop speech processing techniques for early detection of conditions that impact on
                speech production. The outcomes will be cheap and non-invasive diagnostic tools that provide early
                warning of the onset of progressive conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
                Therapy: We will use newly-emerging speech processing techniques to produce automated speech therapy
                tools. These tools will make therapy more accessible and more individually targeted. Better therapy can
                increase the chances of recovering intelligible speech after traumatic events such a stroke or oral
                surgery.
                Assisted Living: We will re-design current speech technology so that it works well for people with
                speech impairments and also helps in making informed clinical choices. People with speech impairments
                often have other co-occurring conditions making them reliant on carers. Speech-driven tools for
                assisted-living are a way to allow such people to live more independently.
                TAPAS adopts an inter-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approach. The consortium includes clinical
                practitioners, academic researchers and industrial partners, with expertise spanning speech engineering,
                linguistics and clinical science. All members have expertise in some element of pathological speech.
                This rich network will train a new generation of 15 researchers, equipping them with the skills and
                resources necessary for lasting success.
                There are a total of 15 ESRs on TAPAS, two of whom are working in Sheffield:

            <h3>HPC</h3>
            <p>The Department of Health has identified a need to utilise technology to help manage demand on memory
                clinic assessments, accurately detecting progression from MCI (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer’s
                Disease and improving efficiency of staff time. Occupational Therapists (OTs) play a key role in the
                management of people with MCI (PwMCI), running follow-up clinics at both Sheffield memory clinics.

                There is a national challenge with missed appointments costing the NHS £150 million per year. Digital
                remote appointments are a solution to address this challenge.

                CognoSpeak is an automated cognitive assessment tool that uses an on-screen Digital Doctor asking
                questions and analysing spoken responses. It can distinguish between AD, MCI and healthy controls and
                can be repeated over time.

                This project will investigate whether OTs can assess PwMCI in their own home using CognoSpeak in
                combination with the ViVA remote visit system. PwMCI would use their own smartphone or tablet
                (facilitated by support worker or family member) or have one provided.

                In a recent stakeholder, patient and public consultation the opportunity to utilise technology to
                minimise hospital attendance and bring care closer to home was viewed positively.

                We will run workshops involving all end-users on what is required to use technology to manage PwMCI
                remotely. We will recruit 10 PwMCI to use this system in a real clinical setting from the two hospital
                memory clinics in Sheffield.

                This is a new collaboration between STH, SHSCT, TUoS, SHU, Sheffield City Council and Age UK.</p>
