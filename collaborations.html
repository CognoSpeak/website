            <h3>Therapy Box Ltd</h3>

            <p>In 2019, we started collaborating with Therapy Box. They are an SME based in London with extensive
                experience in health technology, and a track record of successfully commercialising speech-related
                technology in the NHS, and abroad.
                They have developed a number of successful speech-based technologies including the <a
                    href="https://therapy-box.co.uk/vocatempo">VocaTempo</a> with researchers at the University of
                Sheffield.
                Therapy Box is also a partner on the EU H2020 Training network <a
                    href="https://www.tapas-etn-eu.org/">TAPAS</a> where Christensen is the Sheffield PI.</p>
            <p>In early 2020, we ran a workshop with Therapy Box (fascilitated by <a
                    href="https://wearemhabitat.com/">mHabitat</a>) for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
                Alzheimer's Disease and their families to explore barriers to uptake of a technology like
                CognoSpeak&trade;. We also worked with clinicians in the diagnostic pathway to map out how
                CognoSpeak&trade; will be
                integrated in current primary and secondary care.</p>

            <h3>Devices for Dignity</h3>

            <p><a href="https://devicesfordignity.org.uk/">Devices for Dignity</a> is an NIHR MedTech Co-operative based
                in Sheffield. They are based with the NHS and specialise in aiding the adoption of innovative medical
                devices, healthcare technologies and technology-dependent interventions. We have worked with Lise
                Sproson to develop grant proposals and fascilitate work with our local PPIE groups.</p>

            <h3>Israac Somali Community Association</h3>
            <p>Since 2020, we have worked with <a href="https://israacsheffield.wordpress.com/">Israac</a> that is a
                local Somali community group. We are exploring barriers they are experiencing with accessing the current
                diagnostic pathway for people with memory problems including early signs of dementia.</p>
